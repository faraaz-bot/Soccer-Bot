Premier Soccer Bot League
This repository contains details about our participation in the Premier Soccer Bot League. Our team, developed a custom soccer bot to compete in the league, utilizing advanced design, hardware integration, and programming techniques.

Bot Design and Implementation
Design and Hardware
Bracket Design: We used SolidWorks to design a custom bracket for our bot. This bracket was 3D printed to ensure precise fitting and durability.
Bot Assembly: The core of our bot was an Arduino 4WD kit car. We assembled the kit and incorporated Arduino Bluetooth for wireless control.
Software and Programming
Movement Control: We programmed our bot's movements using C++ and Java. Special algorithms were developed to enhance gameplay and adapt to various scenarios during the competition.
Bluetooth Integration: A custom mobile app was used to control the bot's movements via Bluetooth. This app communicated with the Arduino to execute commands.
